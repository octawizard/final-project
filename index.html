title="Le Corbusier at work">
<strong>Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris</strong>, better known as <strong>Le Corbusier</strong> (October 6, 1887 – August 27, 1965), was an architect, designer, painter, urban planner, writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called modern architecture. He was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930. His career spanned five decades, with his buildings constructed throughout Europe, India, and America. He was a pioneer in studies of modern high design and was dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal and AIA Gold Medal in 1961.
Le Corbusier adopted his pseudonym in the 1920s, allegedly deriving it in part from the name of an ancestor, Lecorbésier.<br>
His work in the early days hampered by its alleged "revolutionary" nature and the radical look it acquired from experiences "purist" with the passing of time has had and continues to have the proper recognition.<br>
His message is being increasingly absorbed by large sections of user, and his attitude of avant-gardism to the bitter end must be interpreted in the right measure, recognizing that in its design method, the use of rational systems with extremely simple forms and shapes, based on the functional logic.</p>

<a name="le-corbusiers-furniture" class="anchor" href="#le-corbusiers-furniture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Le Corbusier's furniture</h3>

<p><em>Le Corbusier said: "Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois".</em><br>
Le Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, Charlotte Perriand, to join his studio. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by Thonet, the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s.<br>
In 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui into practice. In the book he defined three different furniture types: <strong>type-needs</strong>, <strong>type-furniture</strong>, and <strong>human-limb objects</strong>. He defined human-limb objects as: <em>"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony".</em><br>
The first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Villa_Jeanneret">La Maison La Roche</a> in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 Salon d'Automne installation, 'Equipment for the Home'.<br>
In the year 1964, while Le Corbusier was still alive, <a href="http://www.cassina.it">Cassina S.p.A.</a> of Milan acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture his furniture designs. Today many copies exist, but Cassina is still the only manufacturer authorized by the Fondation Le Corbusier.</p>

<a name="chosen-lc-furniture" class="anchor" href="#chosen-lc-furniture"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Chosen LC furniture</h3>

<p>The goal was to use a <strong>modular approach</strong> to create the chosen furniture, carefully choosing how to decompose the model into submodels, then properly assemble all the components. <br>
Very important furniture were the <em>LC-2</em>, <em>LC-3</em>, and <em>LC-4</em> models, originally titled "Fauteuil grand confort, petit modèle" (LC-2, "great comfort sofa, small model"), "Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle" (LC-3, "great comfort sofa, large model"), and "Chaise longue" (LC-4, "Long chair").The LC-2 and LC-3 are more colloquially referred to as the petit confort and grand confort (abbreviation of full title, and due to respective sizes). The LC-2 (and similar LC-3) have been featured in a variety of media, notably the Maxell "blown away" advertisement. <br><em>LC2</em>, <em>LC3</em> and <em>LC4</em> were chosen for their elegance, beauty of design and ability to take advantage of the modular approach required for this project. As evidence of the use of that approach, it should also be noted that LC2 and LC3 are generated by the same code, changing only the parameter that represents the couch number of seats.<br>
Were also modeled <em>LC10</em>, which is a simple but elegant low table suitable for a living room, and <em>LC16</em> together with <em>LC14</em>, which make up an elegant wood colored library accompanied by a small table and two singular chairs with same color; once again a modular approach to modeling is very useful in terms of elegance of code and facilitation of assembly of the various components.<br>
All components have been chosen in order to furnish an <strong>elegant living room</strong> with the beautiful indoor models designed by the genius of Le Corbusier.<br>
At first the models have been implemented as prototypes using the Python module Pyplasm, only to be finished and detailed in a second stage, exploiting plasm.js. Having all models a high level of detail, have been implemented in several files, in order to make the run of its script as quick as possible.</p>

<p>The basic idea was to decompose the model into two coarse grain parts, the <strong>seat</strong> and the <strong>arms</strong> of the sofa. To implement from time to time a single armchair or sofa variable size with a variable number of places, the idea is to replicate a number of times equal to the number of seats the sub-odel <em>"seat"</em> and placing armrests to the extremes of this new submodel obtained.<br>
  Increasing the level of detail of decomposition, we have that the two parts are in turn divided into <strong>smaller sub-models</strong>. For example, the "seat" is divided into subparts that represent the various cushions that compose it, as well as the frame tubes encircling it on the back. Regarding the armrests, we have a decomposition in a complex system of pipes that form the structure on which rests the sofa.<br>
  The levels of decomposition are varied, until arriving to the building of elementary objects to assemble.<br>
  Below are shown the various components of the prototype developed using the Python module Pyplasm. Subsequently the prototype is shown resulting from the assembly of its various components.<br>
<a href="https://github.com/octawizard/final-project/blob/master/python/LC2.py" target="_blank">
<img src="https://raw.github.com/octawizard/final-project/gh-pages/images/myImages/LC2/seats.png" title="click to see the python code">
</a>
</p>

<p>Every part of the pipe is built using the PLASM function CUBIC_HERMITE, which allows to obtain a regular pipe, a constant diameter also in the changes of direction along the various the plane axes. The example below shows the javascript code used to implement a generic part of the pipe.
<pre><code>$  c1 = CUBIC_HERMITE(S0)([[dx + 0.38, 0, 5.33],[dx + 0.38 +0.22+0.1, 0, 5.33+0.34],[0,0,0.75],[0.75,0,0]])
$  c2 = CUBIC_HERMITE(S0)([[dx + 0.38 +0.22, 0, 5.33],[dx + 0.38 +0.22+0.1, 0, 5.33 +0.12],[0,0,0.25],[0.25,0,0]])
$  sur1 = CUBIC_HERMITE(S1)([c1,c2,[0,0.44,0],[0,-0.44,0]])
$  sur1 = MAP(sur1)(domain2D)
$  sur2 = CUBIC_HERMITE(S1)([c1,c2,[0,-0.44,0],[0,0.44,0]])
$  sur2 = MAP(sur2)(domain2D)
$  f1x = STRUCT([sur1, sur2])
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Another interesting part is that relating to the algorithm used to distribute the seats of the sofa, from the origin of the axes. Shown below is the javascript code that implements it. The function getSeats takes as parameters the length, the x-axis, the seating position and the total number of seats of the couch (from one to an arbitrarily large number).
<pre><code>$ function getSeats(dx, n){
$   var seat = STRUCT([getSeatSkeleton(dx+0.05), getSeatPillows(dx)]);
$   var seats = [];
$   var j = 1;
$   var i;
$   if (n % 2 === 0){
$      for (i=1; i<=n; i=i+2){
$         if (i===1){
$             seats.push(T([0])([dx])(seat), T([0])([-dx])(seat));
$         }
$         else {
$           seats.push(T([0])([j*2*dx + dx])(seat));
$           seats.push(T([0])([(j*2*dx + dx)*-1])(seat));
$           j++;
$         }
$       }
$   }
$   else{
$     seats.push(seat);
$     for (i=2; i<=n; i=i+2){
$         seats.push(T([0])([2*dx*j])(seat), T([0])([-2*dx*j])(seat));
$         j++;
$     }
$   }
$   var all_seats = STRUCT(seats);
$   return (all_seats);
$}
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>In the following code is instead shown the composition of the sub-models, coarse, which are placed in a STRUCT to assemble the model LC2, in case of an armchair, or LC3 in the case of a sofa. The models <em>arms</em> and <em>seats</em> are in turn broken down into sub simpler models.
<pre><code>$ var seats = getSeats(seat_dx/2, numberOfSeats);
$ var arms = getArms(seat_dx/2, numberOfSeats);
$ var modelLC2 = STRUCT([seats, arms, getAdditionalPipes(seat_dx/2, numberOfSeats)]);
$ DRAW(modelLC2);
</code></pre>
</p>

<p>Here is a picture of the complete model implemented by exploiting plasm.js LC2.
