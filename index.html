<p>Charles-Édouard Jeanneret-Gris, better known as Le Corbusier (October 6, 1887 – August 27, 1965), was an architect, designer, painter, urban planner, writer, and one of the pioneers of what is now called modern architecture. He was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930. His career spanned five decades, with his buildings constructed throughout Europe, India, and America. He was a pioneer in studies of modern high design and was dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal and AIA Gold Medal in 1961.
Le Corbusier adopted his pseudonym in the 1920s, allegedly deriving it in part from the name of an ancestor, Lecorbésier.
His work in the early days hampered by its alleged "revolutionary» nature and the radical look it acquired from experiences "purist" with the passing of time has had and continues to have the proper recognition.
His message is being increasingly absorbed by large sections of user, and his attitude of avant-gardism to the bitter end must be interpreted in the right measure, recognizing that in its design method, the use of rational systems with extremely simple forms and shapes, based on the functional logic.

<p>Corbusier said: "Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois".
Le Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, Charlotte Perriand, to join his studio. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by Thonet, the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s.
In 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui into practice. In the book he defined three different furniture types: type-needs, type-furniture, and human-limb objects. He defined human-limb objects as: "Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony".
The first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, The Maison la Roche in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 Salon d'Automne installation, 'Equipment for the Home'.
In the year 1964, while Le Corbusier was still alive, Cassina S.p.A. of Milan acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture his furniture designs. Today many copies exist, but Cassina is still the only manufacturer authorized by the Fondation Le Corbusier.</p>

<p>The goal was to use a modular approach to create the chosen furniture, carefully choosing how to decompose the model into submodels, then properly assemble all the components. 
Very important furniture were the LC-2, LC-3, and LC-4 models, originally titled "Fauteuil grand confort, petit modèle" (LC-2, "great comfort sofa, small model"), "Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle" (LC-3, "great comfort sofa, large model"), and "Chaise longue" (LC-4, "Long chair").The LC-2 and LC-3 are more colloquially referred to as the petit confort and grand confort (abbreviation of full title, and due to respective sizes). The LC-2 (and similar LC-3) have been featured in a variety of media, notably the Maxell "blown away" advertisement.
LC2, LC3 and LC4 were chosen for their elegance, beauty of design and ability to take advantage of the modular approach required. As evidence of the use of that approach, it should also be noted that LC2 and LC3 are generated by the same code, changing only the parameter that represents the number of seats of the couch.
Were also modeled LC10, which is a simple but elegant low table suitable for a living room, and LC16 together with LC14, which make up an elegant wood colored library accompanied by a small table and two singular chairs with same color; once again a modular approach to modeling is very useful in terms of elegance of code and facilitation of assembly of the various components.
All components have been chosen in order to furnish an elegant living room with the beautiful indoor models designed by the genius of Le Corbusier.
At first the models have been implemented as prototypes using the module pyplasm, only to be finished and detailed in a second stage, exploiting plasm.js. Having all models a high level of detail, have been implemented in several files, in order to make the run of its script as quick as possible.</p>

<p>The system of LC16 consists of cabinet and shelf, oak wood, veneer, natural finish. The compartment is equipped with fixed shelves. It 'is possible to extend the modularity of the cabinet with the item per day, which is can be aggregated to the rest of the system.
The LC14 is a stool in solid oak, natural dyed. Present, the two main facades, openings practices that promote the movement of the object.</p>
