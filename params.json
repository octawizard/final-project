He was born in Switzerland and became a French citizen in 1930. His career spanned five decades, with his buildings constructed throughout Europe, India, and America. He was a pioneer in studies of modern high design and was dedicated to providing better living conditions for the residents of crowded cities. He was awarded the Frank P. Brown Medal and AIA Gold Medal in 1961.\r\nLe Corbusier adopted his pseudonym in the 1920s, allegedly deriving it in part from the name of an ancestor, Lecorbésier.\r\nHis work in the early days hampered by its alleged \"revolutionary» nature and the radical look it acquired from experiences \"purist\" with the passing of time has had and continues to have the proper recognition.\r\nHis message is being increasingly absorbed by large sections of user, and his attitude of avant-gardism to the bitter end must be interpreted in the right measure, recognizing that in its design method, the use of rational systems with extremely simple forms and shapes, based on the functional logic.\r\nAfter your page is generated, you can check out the new branch:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd your_repo_root/repo_name\r\n$ git fetch origin\r\n$ git checkout gh-pages\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Le Corbusier's furniture\r\nCorbusier said: \"Chairs are architecture, sofas are bourgeois\".\r\nLe Corbusier began experimenting with furniture design in 1928 after inviting the architect, Charlotte Perriand, to join his studio. His cousin, Pierre Jeanneret, also collaborated on many of the designs. Before the arrival of Perriand, Le Corbusier relied on ready-made furniture to furnish his projects, such as the simple pieces manufactured by Thonet, the company that manufactured his designs in the 1930s.\r\nIn 1928, Le Corbusier and Perriand began to put the expectations for furniture Le Corbusier outlined in his 1925 book L'Art Décoratif d'aujourd'hui into practice. In the book he defined three different furniture types: type-needs, type-furniture, and human-limb objects. He defined human-limb objects as: \"Extensions of our limbs and adapted to human functions that are type-needs and type-functions, therefore type-objects and type-furniture. The human-limb object is a docile servant. A good servant is discreet and self-effacing in order to leave his master free. Certainly, works of art are tools, beautiful tools. And long live the good taste manifested by choice, subtlety, proportion, and harmony\".\r\nThe first results of the collaboration were three chrome-plated tubular steel chairs designed for two of his projects, The Maison la Roche in Paris and a pavilion for Barbara and Henry Church. The line of furniture was expanded for Le Corbusier's 1929 Salon d'Automne installation, 'Equipment for the Home'.\r\nIn the year 1964, while Le Corbusier was still alive, Cassina S.p.A. of Milan acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture his furniture designs. Today many copies exist, but Cassina is still the only manufacturer authorized by the Fondation Le Corbusier.\r\n\r\n### Chosen LC furniture\r\nThe goal was to use a modular approach to create the chosen furniture, carefully choosing how to decompose the model into submodels, then properly assemble all the components. \r\nVery important furniture were the LC-2, LC-3, and LC-4 models, originally titled \"Fauteuil grand confort, petit modèle\" (LC-2, \"great comfort sofa, small model\"), \"Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle\" (LC-3, \"great comfort sofa, large model\"), and \"Chaise longue\" (LC-4, \"Long chair\").The LC-2 and LC-3 are more colloquially referred to as the petit confort and grand confort (abbreviation of full title, and due to respective sizes). The LC-2 (and similar LC-3) have been featured in a variety of media, notably the Maxell \"blown away\" advertisement.\r\nLC2, LC3 and LC4 were chosen for their elegance, beauty of design and ability to take advantage of the modular approach required. As evidence of the use of that approach, it should also be noted that LC2 and LC3 are generated by the same code, changing only the parameter that represents the number of seats of the couch.\r\nWere also modeled LC10, which is a simple but elegant low table suitable for a living room, and LC16 together with LC14, which make up an elegant wood colored library accompanied by a small table and two singular chairs with same color; once again a modular approach to modeling is very useful in terms of elegance of code and facilitation of assembly of the various components.\r\nAll components have been chosen in order to furnish an elegant living room with the beautiful indoor models designed by the genius of Le Corbusier.\r\nAt first the models have been implemented as prototypes using the module pyplasm, only to be finished and detailed in a second stage, exploiting plasm.js. Having all models a high level of detail, have been implemented in several files, in order to make the run of its script as quick as possible.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Project\r\n### LC2 Petit Modèle _with_ LC3 Fauteuil grand confort, grand modèle (1928)\r\nArmchair, two-or three-seater and ottoman with polished chrome steel, which can be painted in various colors. Loose cushions with polyurethane foam and polyester wadding or feather with polyurethane foam insert. Cover in leather or fabric.\r\n\r\n### LC4 Chaise Longue à réglage continu (1928)\r\nChaise-longue with variable inclination, cradle steel with polished chrome or matte black enamel. Steel pedestal painted matt black. Mattress with headrest padding polyester wadding.\r\n\r\n### LC10-P Low Table (1928)\r\nTable downs of square and rectangular, with legs in chromed steel and steel frame. Glass tops or molded glass.\r\n\r\n### LC16 Table De Travail Avec Rayonnages (1957) _with_ LC14-02 Tabouret Maison du Brésil(1952)\r\nThe system of LC16 consists of cabinet and shelf, oak wood, veneer, natural finish. The compartment is equipped with fixed shelves. It 'is possible to extend the modularity of the cabinet with the item per day, which is can be aggregated to the rest of the system.\r\nThe LC14 is a stool in solid oak, natural dyed. Present, the two main facades, openings practices that promote the movement of the object.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages?
